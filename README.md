For any gravitational system containing two bodies, there exist general analytical solutions for their positions, velocities, and accelerations using Newton's laws of motion and gravity. However, with three bodies or more, this is no longer true. With the exception of a handful of special cases, these equations must be solved numerically using algorithms such as Euler's or Runge-Kutta methods.
